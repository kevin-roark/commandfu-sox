SoX is a command-line audio processing tool good for quickies and batch tasks. It is based on libSox, which audacity (the GUI)
may or may not be related to. You can use it on its own to do neat things, or you can hook it in to other programming languages
(which I won't get into, but you can see here:https://github.com/kevin-roark/arthur).

Play some musics:
  sox club.mp3 -d

Record some musics:
  sox -d bang.mp3

-d is just a shorthand for a device. You can use it in place of any
filename and do any of the other commands.


SOX IS ON SOURCEFORGE SO YOU KNOW IT IS LEGIT.

Concatenate some musics:

  sox glass.mp3 bang.mp3 glassbang.mp3

Mix some musics:
  sox -m glass.mp3 bang.mp3 gblasng.mp3

Boost the bass on gblasng.mp3 as we play it:

  sox gblasng.mp3 -d bass +5


LIKE ALL NICE COMMAND LINE THINGS, YOU LEARN SIMPLE COMMANDS AND CAN COMPOSE
THIM TOGETHER IN A COOL WAY. I'M TALKING PIPES

Boost the bass on gblasng.mp3, pipe it into something that slows it down:

  sox "|sox gblasng.mp3 -p bass +5" -d speed 0.25

Of course, the use case for piping is sort of moot cause you can also do this:

  sox gblasng.mp3 -d bass +5 speed 0.25


SOME OTHER NEAT COMMANDS?!?! YOU WANT EM? I GOT EM?

Band-pass filter:

  sox club.mp3 -d band 3 100

Chorus is nuts:
  // this is gain-in, gain-out, delay, decay, speed, depth (sin, triangle)
  sox future.mp3 -d 0.5 0.9 50 0.4 0.25 2 −t 60 0.32 0.4 2.3 −t 40 0.3 0.3 1.3 −s

Audio contrast? hi zach:
  sox glass.mp3 -d
  sox glass.mp3 -d contrast 100

ECHO ECHO:
  sox club.mp3 -d 0.8 0.88 800 0.4

make it real loud:
  sox club.mp3 -d gain -n 10

I could keep going and going, but here is a pitch shift:

  sox future.mp3 -d

  sox honest.mp3 -d pitch 1000

  sox future.mp3 -d pitch -1000


YOU CAN COMEBINE ALL OF THESE THINGS. IT CAN BE REALLY FUN TOY.

  sox honest.mp3 -d pitch 1000 gain -n 10 bass +5 speed 0.5


YOU CAN ALSO ANALYZE THE audio (imagine piping this into a text file lol):

  sox future.mp3 -n stat


OTHER TOOLS EXIST BUT I REALLY LIKE SOX. FFMPEG CAN DO SOME SIMILAR THINGS
WITH BOTH AUDIO AND VIDEO BUT THAT IS A DIFFERENT TALK.
